# Worklog

## 17 Jan 2026

### What changed
1. Added the missing process documents required by the project workflow.
2. Seeded an initial task list with the current known priorities.

### Why
The maintenance workflow expects docs/PLANNING.md, docs/TASKS.md, docs/WORKLOG.md, and docs/DELIVERABLES.md to exist before any implementation work, so that tasks and verification stay traceable.

### How it was verified
1. Confirmed files exist in docs directory.

### Notes
1. Next step should be to pick the single NEXT task from docs/TASKS.md and implement it with minimal changes.
